This is a fork of Ronald Kuivila's Conductor library, a collection of sclang classes for [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io), a programming environment and audio-synthesis engine. Due to recent changes in sclang (the programming language used within SuperCollider) I needed to apply some fixes that are not contained yet in the original version of Conductor.
The original Conductor library can be installed from within SuperCollider's inbuilt quarks package manager: [SC 3.6.x](http://sourceforge.net/p/quarks/code/HEAD/tree/) or the new GIT-based package-manager, currently available for [SC 3.7 and up](https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/quarks). However, the quarks-version will very likely not work properly with SC version 3.7 or higher.
